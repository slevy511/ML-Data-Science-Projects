DO NOT CHANGE THIS FUNCTION.

Annotates your filtered image with the values you calculate.

PARAMETERS:
img -               Your filtered BINARY image, converted to BGR or
                    RGB form using cv2.cvtColor().

contours -          The list of all contours in the image.

contour_index -     The index of the specific contour to annotate.

moment -            The coordinates of the moment of inertia of
                    the contour at `contour_index`. Represented as an
                    iterable with 2 elements (x, y).

midline -           The starting and ending points of the line that
                    divides the contour's bounding box in half,
                    horizontally. Represented as an iterable with 2
                    tuples, ( (sx,sy) , (ex,ey) ), where `sx` and `sy`
                    represent the starting point and `ex` and `ey` the
                    ending point.

instruction -       A string chosen from "left", "right", "straight", "stop",
                    or "idle".

PART 3
0. Before doing any of the following, arm your ESC by following the instructions in the
   spec. You only have to do this once. Than the range will be remembered by the ESC
1. Set up two GPIO pins of your choice, one for the ESC and one for the Servo.
   IMPORTANT: Make sure your chosen pins aren't reserved for something else! See pinout.xyz
   for more details.
2. Start each pin with its respective "neutral" pwm signal. This should be around 8% for both.
   The servo may be slightly off center. Fix this by readjusting the arm of the servo (unscrew it,
   set the servo to neutral, make the wheel point straight, then reattach the arm). The arm may still
   not be perfectly alighned so use the manual_pwm.py program to determine your Servo's best neutral
   position.
3. Start the motor at the full-forward position (duty cycle = 5.7).

NOTE: If you change the variable names pwm_m and pwm_s, you'll also need to update the
      cleanup code at the bottom of this skeleton.

Checkoffs: None for this part!
