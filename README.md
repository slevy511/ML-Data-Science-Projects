# ML-Data-Science-Projects
A collection of recent Machine Learning/Data Science projects for my SRI Lab application. Hello Sven, Alex, and John! :)


# Table of Contents

TimelineMakerV1.py - A timeline creation program that I created for the UCLA USAC (Undergraduate Student Association Council) Sustainability Committee. It takes in timeline data and constructs a timeline from the data, for use on websites and infographics. I designed the program to be runnable by non-tech-savvy folks!

Intro_to_ML_Lab.py - An introductory Machine-Learning Project I completed with the IEEE Pocket Racers Team. Implements Linear Regression, Gradient Descent, One-Hot Encoding, Logistic Regression, and K-fold Cross Validation.

framingham.csv & weatherHistory.csv - data files used in the ML lab file above. 

Dice.py - A program for an IEEE "Pocket Racers" project in which I had to train my (work-in-progress) car to detect dice within its camera's field of view, and detect which side of the die (or dice) it is seeing. This was implemented using openCV and numPy, and can handle both colored and black-and-white dice.
