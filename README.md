timelinemakerv1.py - A timeline creation program that I created for the UCLA USAC (Undergraduate Student Association Council) Sustainability Committee. It takes in timeline data and constructs a timeline from the data, for use on websites and infographics. I designed the program to be runnable by non-tech-savvy folks!

sammy_levy_intro_to_ml_lab.py - An introductory Machine-Learning Project I completed with the IEEE Pocket Racers Team. Implements Linear Regression, Gradient Descent, One-Hot Encoding, Logistic Regression, and K-fold Cross Validation.
